# Reddit-Cappuccin

Attempt at implementing [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin.git) theme to Reddit. It is still very much WIP, and I lack the skills and time to really do much more than this, so any help would be appreciated! :)

Original Code is from [Reddit-blend-rice](https://userstyles.org/styles/252687/reddit-blend-rice) by [Syed Ali Hyder](https://github.com/alisyd). He deserves all the credits.
